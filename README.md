# Social Network Project

## Overview
This project implements a social network application using Django. The application allows users to create accounts, make posts, follow other users, and like posts. It supports modern features like pagination, editing posts, and asynchronous updates.

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: Managed by Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system.
2. **Post Creation and Editing**: Supports secure creation and editing of posts.
3. **Likes and Follows**: Updates are performed asynchronously using JavaScript and `fetch` API.
4. **Pagination**: Posts are displayed 10 per page with navigation controls.
